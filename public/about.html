                    <p>After years of competing in high-altitude races and training elite athletes in the Himalayas, Shashwat recognized a significant gap in specialized altitude training for trail runners looking to improve their performance.</p>
                    <p>Most runners lack access to proper high-altitude training environments and the technical knowledge needed to adapt and excel in these challenging conditions.</p>
                    <p>This bootcamp was born from Shashwat's desire to share his expertise and the incredible terrain of Lahaul to help runners achieve breakthroughs in their performance while building a stronger trail running community in India.</p>
