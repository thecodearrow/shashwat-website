                <h2>I AM NOT A COACH</h2>
                <h3>Sharing the Trail: An Athlete's Journey to Empower Others</h3>
            </div>
            
            <div class="manifesto-content">
                <p>For years, I've navigated technical trailsâ€”rocky descents, root-strewn climbs, unpredictable switchbacksâ€”as a competitive athlete. But what excites me now isn't chasing personal accolades. It's watching someone else conquer a section of trail they once feared, or unlock a skill that transforms their confidence. And I want to help make that happenâ€”without labels, without ego, and without turning it into a business.</p>
                
                <h4>Why I'm Doing This</h4>
                <p>Technical trails demand more than fitness; they require nuance. Foot placement, balance, mental composure, and reading terrain are arts honed through repetitionâ€”and often, through mistakes. I've made plenty of those. Early in my career, I wished for someone to point out the subtle gaps in my technique: how to trust my instincts, when to slow versus flow, or how to recover from a misstep without panic. Elites changed my trajectory. Now, I want to pay that forward.</p>
                
                <p>But I'm not a "coach." That word carries a formal weight, a transactional implication. In India, top coaches are bestowed with the Dronacharya award - following the guru-shishya parampara. That's huge. I can't relate to that. Coaches build programs, set schedules, and charge rates. I'm here to run/walk (strength train, bike, or scramble) alongside athletes as a peer who's still learning too. My role? A collaborator. A trail partner with a sharper eye.</p>
                
                <h4>The Model</h4>
                <p>This isn't a side hustle. Camps are donation-based, with a simple ask: cover the basics (food, stay, my time) if you can. If you can't, come anyway. Financial barriers shouldn't keep someone from growing. I've seen too many athletes plateau or quit because they couldn't afford guidance, and too many "coaches" prioritize clients who pay premium fees. That's not how community works.</p>
                
                <h4>On ground, in-person</h4>
                <p>We'll meet on the trail, dissect your movement in real time, and troubleshoot issues where they happenâ€”not in a gym or via a video call. The goal is adaptability, not rigid formulas. Excel sheets are a dime a dozen on the internet. Technical terrain doesn't follow a script, and neither should training. Added bonus: picturesque views, majestic skies and mountain bliss - essentially, time away from hustle and bustle.</p>
                
                <p>I don't want reverence. Respect is earned by showing upâ€”not just for sessions, but for the sport itself. I'll share what I know, but I'll also listen. Maybe you've mastered a skill I haven't. Maybe your fears mirrors mine five years ago. This is a dialogue. The trail humbles everyone, and there's no room for hierarchy when we all are in deep shit during a long run.</p>
                
                <p>If an athlete finishes a session with one "aha" momentâ€”a downhill belted confidently, reducing idle time, or simply optimizing gear usageâ€”that's enough. This isn't about creating clones of my style; it's about helping others find theirs.</p>
                
                <p>I won't promise podiums or PRs. I'll promise honesty: if your cadence is reckless, I'll say so. If you're overthinking, we'll simplify. And if you're ready to push harder, I'll match your pace. I'll guarantee you improvement. How? Because yearn for improving myself.</p>
                
                <p>This isn't a career pivot. It's a return to what sport should be: passionate people lifting each other up, one rocky mile at a time.</p>
                
                <p>Just trails, sweat, and the occasional shared laugh when we both eat dirt.</p>
